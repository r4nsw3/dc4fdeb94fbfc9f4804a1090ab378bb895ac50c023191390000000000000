  |   Hey ladies, I'm back in business! My new adventure, Leisure Suit      |
  |   Larry - Wet Dreams Don't Dry, takes me - whatever the route or        |
  |   twist of fate - from the end of the '80s directly into the 21st       |
  |   century and wow, how the world has changed! While my view of the      |
  |   world and women from way back in the 1980s collides with modern       |
  |   reality harder than the breasts of a lusciously stacked blonde        |
  |   jogging along a beach, I'm all set to date my way across the modern   |
  |   world!                                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In a "point & click" adventure I'd call typical for the genre we      |
  |   mutually experience how I fall head-over-heels in love with Faith,    |
  |   the hot-to-trot assistant to the boss at Prune, a technology          |
  |   enterprise successful worldwide. Since even dating is done            |
  |   digitally nowadays, the first thing I have to do is to work on my     |
  |   score at Timber, the totally hip, can't-get-anywhere-without-it       |
  |   dating app where I date women, satisfy their needs, and accordingly   |
  |   pick up points for my Timber profile. And whenever I get a chance     |
  |   in between, always briefly check out a few new bikini pix at          |
  |   Instacrap - the 21st century is gnarly smill!                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Leisure Suit Larry is coming in the 21st century - and no,          |
  |     there's no word missing here                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Explore a lovingly designed, non-linear game world set in the       |
  |     modern world with over 30 handdrawn venues                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Use "Timber", the ingame app, along with an innovative dating       |
  |     mechanism to date women, consequently improve your score at         |
  |     Timber, and ultimately clear the way to get to Faith, the women     |
  |     of your dreams                                                      |
